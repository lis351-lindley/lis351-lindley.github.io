            <h3>Dirt by Alice In Chains</h3>
            <p>Dirt is the second studio album by American rock band Alice in Chains. It was released on September 29, 1992, by Columbia Records. 
                Peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart, the album received critical acclaim. It has since been certified quintuple platinum 
                by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. It was the band's 
                last album recorded with all four original members, as bassist Mike Starr was fired in January 1993 during the tour to support the album.</p>

            <h3>Core by Stone Temple Pilots</h3>
            <p>Core is the debut studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released by Atlantic Records on September 29, 1992. 
                Produced by Brendan O'Brien, Core displayed the band's inspiration of alternative rock, with a diverse range of heavy metal and acoustic influences 
                from the 1970s, in contrast to the dark sludgy sound seen by the rising grunge scene. The lyrical content covers a range of gloomy topics such as lost 
                innocence, relationships, confusion, and religion. Core became a massive commercial success, reaching number three on the Billboard 200 by July 1993 and 
                has since been certified 8x Platnium by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p>

            <h3>Nevermind by Nirvana</h3>
            <p>Nevermind is the second studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. It was Nirvana's first release on a major label 
                and the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work.
                 It was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, in May and June 1991, and mastered that August
                  at the Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Written primarily by frontman Kurt Cobain, Nevermind is noted for channeling a range of emotions, being
                   noted as dark, humorous, and disturbing. It includes anti-establishment views, anti-sexism, frustration, alienation, and troubled love inspired by 
                   Cobain's broken relationship with Bikini Kill's Tobi Vail. </p>

            <h3>Purple by Stone Temple Pilots</h3>
            <p>Purple (stylized on the cover art in its Chinese character ç´«) is the second studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on 
                June 7, 1994, by Atlantic Records. The album, building on the foundation laid by the band's debut album Core (1992), was a major commercial success, 
                debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 252,000 copies sold in its first week. It remained at the top of the chart for three weeks, eventually 
                selling over six million copies. It spawned a number of successful singles; "Vasoline" and "Interstate Love Song" both topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks
                 chart and reached number 2 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while "Big Empty" also reached the top ten on both charts. Lesser known album cuts "Pretty
                  Penny" and "Unglued" were released as promotional radio singles.</p>

            <h3>Superunkown by Soundgarden</h3>
            <p>Superunknown is the fourth studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on March 8, 1994, through A&M Records. Produced by Michael Beinhorn 
                and the band themselves, Soundgarden began work on the album after touring in support of its previous album, Badmotorfinger (1991). Superunknown
                 retained the heaviness of the band's earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences. Superunknown was a critical and commercial
                  success and became the band's breakthrough album. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 310,000 copies in its opening week. The album
                 also topped the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand charts. </p>

                feat on September 11, 1991. The album peaked at No. 42 on the Billboard 200 chart, and has been certified triple-platinum by the RIAA for 
                shipments of three million copies in the United States.</p>

                 sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington between December 1988 and January 1989. It is the only Nirvana album 
                 released on the Sub Pop label and their only studio album to feature drummer Chad Channing. Bleach did not chart upon initial release, but was well 
                 received by critics.</p>

                 debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, and was eventually certified 4x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the album 
                 selling over six million copies worldwide, catapulting the Smashing Pumpkins to mainstream success and cementing them as a significant group in alternative

            <h3>Use Your Illusion I & II by Guns N' Roses</h3>
            <p>Use Your Illusion I & II are the third and fourth studio albums by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, both released on September 17, 1991.
                They were the band's first albums to feature drummer Matt Sorum, who replaced Steven Adler following Adler's departure in 1990 
                (although he was featured again on "Civil War", which appears on Use Your Illusion II), as well as keyboardist Dizzy Reed. Both albums were released 
                in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 685,000 copies in its first week, behind Use

            <h3>Badmotorfinger by Soundgarden</h3>
            <p>Badmotorfinger is the third studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on October 8, 1991, through A&M Records.
                 Soundgarden began the recording sessions for the album with new bassist Ben Shepherd in the spring of 1991. The album maintained the band's 
                 heavy metal sound, while featuring an increased focus on songwriting compared to the band's previous releases. AllMusic considered the album's
                  music to be "surprisingly cerebral and arty"; alternative tunings and odd time signatures were present on several of the album's songs, and 
                  lyrics were intended to be ambiguous and evocative.</p>
